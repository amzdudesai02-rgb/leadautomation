# 🎯 Hunter.io - Which Option to Select?

### **Why This Option?**

Your Lead Generation Tool **needs API access** because:

1. ✅ **Your backend uses Hunter.io API** - The `EmailFinderService` makes API calls
2. ✅ **Automated email finding** - Happens automatically when scraping sellers/brands
3. ✅ **Includes everything** - This option gives you:
   - Email finding (what you need)
   - Email verification (bonus)
   - API access (required)
